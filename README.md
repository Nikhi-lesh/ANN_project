# Handwritten Digits Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This code repository contains a Python script for classifying handwritten digits using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
## Background

Handwritten digit classification is a popular problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It involves identifying the digit in an image of a handwritten digit. This code repository provides an ANN model to classify handwritten digits.

## Data

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing) in a 28x28 pixel format. Each pixel has a value between 0 and 255, indicating the intensity of the pixel. The images are labeled with the corresponding digit (0 to 9).

The script will automatically download and extract the dataset when you run it for the first time.
